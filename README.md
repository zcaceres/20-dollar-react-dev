# Learning Guide for React
## Become a Proficient React Dev for $20

This syllabus is meant to take you, the motivated learner, from little-to-no experience programmer to a proficient web dev.

Total cost: **$20**

This guide approaches learning to program like learning a language, where knowledge grows through [chunking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/LurUJ/what-is-a-chunk):

You will:
  - Learn your nouns and verbs: Javascript Fundamentals and Syntax
  - Learn how to write sentences with your verbs and nouns: 'Toy apps' in JS
  - Learn how to write in a specialized way, like the first time you wrote a short story or essay in a new language: Making a React app that's sort of real and complete
  - Learn how to communicate on own, without training wheels: Building apps from scratch

## Step 1: Javascript Foundations
- [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org)
  - All HTML5 & CSS3
  - jQuery – Remember, jQuery is made from Javascript!
  - Basic Javascript (All)
  - Object Oriented and Functional Programming (All)
  - Basic Algorithm Scripting (All)
  - Save Your Code Revisions Forever with Git (All)

## Step 2: Building Stuff in Vanilla Javascript
- Do the [30 Days of Javascript challenge](https://javascript30.com/) ... for 30 days
- Get ready to develop modern JS apps:
  - FreeCodeCamp: The DOM, Javascript Lingo, Chrome Developer Tools
  - Get Comfortable with ES6
    - Do [Count-To-6 Workshopper on Nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/)
    - Feel comfortable solving the following [ES6Katas](http://es6katas.org/)
      - Destructuring (Array, Object)
      - String.includes()
      - Template Strings (basic, multiline)
      - Arrow functions (all)
      - Block scope (all)
      - Class (creation, extends)

> **What does *ES6* mean?**
>
> In 2015, Javascript was upgraded with new features and syntax. This upgrade is called ES6 (ECMAScript6). Many of the changes accomplish exactly the same thing as the Javascript that you're familiar with. But it looks different and it's often simpler and more elegant to write. A lot of modern libraries like React use ES6, so to understand them you'll need to know it.


## Step 3: React
Read these topics from [Quickstart](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) in React Docs:
  - Introducing JSX
  - Rendering Elements
  - Components and Props
  - State and Lifecycle (super important!)
  - Handling Events
  - Composition vs Inheritance
  - Thinking In React

You will not understand everything in these topics. That's OK! Just move on after you've read.

Do [React Fundamentals](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)
  - Costs $20, but worth it
  - Think about how React *organizes interfaces* as components that act like reusable LEGO blocks

## Step 4: Make With React
Now you'll repeat the patterns you learned in React Fundamentals by making two more apps. These don't need to be elaborate.

- Follow the instructions to use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as your boilerplate to make 2 small apps using React.

## Step 5: React with Redux
- Do [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

## Step 6: React/Redux Challenge
You're ready to fly!

Make 3-5 small apps using React, Redux, and any other browser APIs that you'd like to use.

I recommend picking a browser API and idea that you can get excited about.
  - Some possible browser APIs to explore in a React App from the 30 day challenge:
    - HTML5 Canvas
    - SVG
    - Web Audio
    - Geolocation API
    - CSS animation
    - Video/Webcam
    - Maps
  - You may use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to scaffold your app, or configure your own React project

Focus on making your apps *modular*, with small, focused components that you can re-use throughout the layout.

## Random Questions

#### What is Markdown?
> Markdown is a markup language that makes writing HTML even simpler than it already is. For example, to make something a headline, you just put a # in front of it. It will automatically be rendered a headline.
