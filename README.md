# Learning Guide for React
## Become a Proficient React Dev for $20

This syllabus is meant to take you, the motivated learner, from little-to-no experience coder to a proficient React developer.

Total cost: **$20**

This guide approaches learning to program like learning a language, where knowledge grows through [chunking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/LurUJ/what-is-a-chunk). Chunking means you master small pieces until they're second nature. Then you can combine those pieces into ever-more-complex designs.

It focuses entirely on React.

You will:
  - Learn your nouns and verbs: Javascript Fundamentals and Syntax
  - Learn how to write sentences with your verbs and nouns: 'Toy apps' in JS
  - Learn how to write in a specialized way, like the first time you wrote a short story or essay in a new language: Following a tutorial to make a React app
  - Learn how to communicate on your own, without training wheels: Building apps from scratch

<!-- TODO: Set up, Github account npm, node etc -->

## Step 1: Javascript Foundations
- [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org)
  - All HTML5 & CSS3
  - jQuery – Remember, jQuery is just a library made from Javascript!
  - Basic Javascript (All)
  - Object Oriented and Functional Programming (All)
  - Basic Algorithm Scripting (All)
  - Save Your Code Revisions Forever with Git (All)

> Git is a version control system (VCS) that you manage changes to your code. It's the cornerstone of collaboration between software developers!

## Step 2: Building Stuff in Plain Javascript
The best way to get the fundamentals under your fingers is to build *many small projects*.

- Do the [30 Days of Javascript challenge](https://javascript30.com/). Save all your projects to a git repo on your Github!

## Step 3: Get Ready for Modern JS Apps:
Watch the FreeCodeCamp videos: The DOM, Javascript Lingo, Chrome Developer Tools

> Developer Tools (also available in different forms in Safari and Firefox) are super important! You'll use them every day.

Get Comfortable with ES6
  - Do [Count-To-6 Workshopper on Nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/)
  - Feel comfortable solving the following [ES6Katas](http://es6katas.org/)
    - Destructuring (Array, Object)
    - String.includes()
    - Template Strings (basic, multiline)
    - Arrow functions (all)
    - Block scope (all)
    - Class (creation, extends)

> **What does *ES6* mean?**
>
> In 2015, Javascript was upgraded with new features and syntax. This upgrade is called ES6 (ECMAScript6). Many of the changes accomplish exactly the same thing as the Javascript that you're familiar with. But it looks different and it's often simpler and more elegant to write. A lot of modern libraries like React use ES6, so to understand them you'll need to know it.

## Step 4: React
Read these topics from [Quickstart](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) in the React Docs:
  - Introducing JSX
  - Rendering Elements
  - Components and Props
  - State and Lifecycle (super important!)
  - Handling Events
  - Composition vs Inheritance
  - Thinking In React

You will not understand everything in these topics. That's OK! Just move on after you've read them.

Do [React Fundamentals](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)
  - Costs $20, but worth it

Think about how React *organizes interfaces* as components that act like reusable LEGO blocks

## Step 5: Make With React
Now you'll repeat the patterns you learned in React Fundamentals by making two more apps.

- Follow the instructions to use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as your boilerplate to make 2 small apps using React.

Don't be fussy about making these beautiful or elaborate. The point is to start from an empty app and work through the process of defining your UI, breaking it down into components, and building those components. If you need help thinking through this process, check out [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) from the React Docs or the [Thinking In React](https://github.com/asbjornenge/thinking-in-react) workshopper from Nodeschool.

## Step 6: React with Redux
- Do [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

> Why Redux?
> As your React application becomes more complex, it gets harder to manage the state and data flow in your components. Redux puts your app's state in one place and makes it incredibly easy to make sure your components react to changes correctly!

## Step 7: React/Redux Challenge
You're ready to fly!

Make 3-5 small apps using React, Redux, and any other browser APIs that you'd like to use.

I recommend picking a browser API and idea that you can get excited about. This will keep you motivated as you work through each app.
  - Some possible browser APIs to explore in a React App from the 30 day challenge:
    - HTML5 Canvas
    - SVG
    - Web Audio
    - Geolocation API
    - CSS animation
    - Video/Webcam
    - Maps
  - You may use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to scaffold your app, or configure your own React project

Remember: Focus on making your apps *modular*, with small, focused components that you can re-use throughout the layout.

## Step 8: Congratulations
Make a portfolio site to show off your work. You can make your site with... yep, you guessed it ... React!

Launch it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free!

## Random Questions

#### What is Markdown?
> Markdown is a markup language that makes writing HTML even simpler than it already is. For example, to make something a headline, you just put a # in front of it. It will automatically be rendered a headline.
